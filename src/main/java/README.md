# coffee-order-app

### Motivation: The design of the coffee-order-app
To design an application that can take a coffee order from a client and have it fulfilled by the server

### First Iteration: Factory Pattern:
A creational pattern that creates an object without exposing the logic to the client.

### Current Description:
The program is started and then:
* User is prompted to select one of several types of coffee
* User enters their selection
* Instructions are "sent" to the virtual barista
* Order is prepared
* User is notified the order is ready
